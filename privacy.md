# Who we are

# What personal data we collect and why we collect it

## Comments

Comments are powered by [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).  View their Privacy Policy here: [https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy](https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy).

## Cookies

This website does not produce any additional cookies.  Disqus or any embedded content, however, might.

## Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

## Analytics

We don't currently collect analytics.  However, embedded content from other sites (e.g. YouTube videos or Disqus) might for their own purposes.

## How long we retain your data

If you are just browsing the site and have no intention of submitting an article, there is no data collected for us to retain.

If you do submit an article, the article is saved in a [git](@Model.Site.Config["github"]) repository forever, and can not be easily erased.  Even if you do contact us asking us to delete the article, it will remain in the git history forever.

## What rights you have over your data

If you are just browsing the site and have no intention of submitting an article, there is no data collected.

If you do submit an article, you may contact us to delete the article, or submit a pull request on the [git repo](@Model.Site.Config["github"]) to delete it.  However, remember, by the nature of how git works, while the website will have the article erased, it will remain in the git history forever.

## Where we send your data

If you are just browsing the site and have no intention of submitting an article, there is no data collected.

If you do submit an article, the markdown and GPX data are saved to the [git](@Model.Site.Config["github"]) repo on GitHub.  Because of the nature of how git works, anyone can clone the repo and save it wherever.  If you are not comfortable with this, do not submit an article.
