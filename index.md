# Welcome!

This website's purpose is to catalog as many safe and practical places to longboard in the Rochester Region.  Each post on this website has a location that specifies if a place is able to be longboarded, is it safe to longboard, what to watch out for while longboarding there, and overall, is a cool, meh, or lame place to longboard.

You can view all of the locations that have been written about on our [map](/bigmap.html).  You can also see a list [here](/posts.html), but all of the cool spots can be viewed [here](/category/cool-places/index.html).

This website statically-generated is entirely open source, one can view it on [GitHub](@Model.Site.Config["github"]).  Submissions are also welcome, see our [submission](/about/submit.html) for information on that.

So, please explore the site for ideas on where to longboard.  And remember, [to wear a helmet](/about/disclaimer.html)!
