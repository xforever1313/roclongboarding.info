## Skate at your own risk

The locations listed here are for informational purposes only.  While one person may find these locations easy to longboard, it does not mean that it is easy for everyone.  Please use good judgement and common-sense to ensure that the location is within your skill level.

This is also the internet, and things can get out-of-date.  Locations, and their availability can change.  Please check prior to ensure locations still allow longboarding (and if not, please get in contact with us at ```@Model.Site.Config["contact"]```).

Also, remember to always wear a helmet and other protective gear.  Remember to avoid skating in traffic or anywhere dangerous.

As always with physical activity, it is best to consult with your doctor to make sure it is right for you.

@Model.Site.Config["url"] is not responsible for any injuries, accidents, or any other mishaps that may happen by skating at a location listed on this site.
